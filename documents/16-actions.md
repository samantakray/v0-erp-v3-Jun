# Server Actions Documentation

## Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the server actions used in the Jewelry ERP system. Each action file serves a specific purpose:

| Action File | Primary Objective |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **order-actions.ts** | Manages the complete lifecycle of orders including creation, updating, deletion, and status tracking. Handles the complex process of generating order IDs and creating associated jobs. |
| **job-actions.ts** | Controls job workflow progression through different phases, updates job statuses, and manages job history. Synchronizes job statuses with parent order statuses. |
| **image-actions.ts** | Handles all image operations for SKUs including uploading, updating, and deleting images from Supabase Storage. |
| **sku-actions.ts** | Manages individual SKU creation and deletion operations with integrated image handling. |
| **sku-sequence-actions.ts** | Generates sequential SKU IDs and handles batch creation of multiple SKUs with shared sequence numbers. |

## Detailed Documentation

### order-actions.ts

**Purpose**: Manages the complete lifecycle of orders in the system.

#### Functions

##### `createOrder(orderData: Omit<Order, "id">)`

Creates a new order in the system with associated order items and jobs.

**Process Flow**:
1. Checks if mock mode is enabled
2. Creates a Supabase service client
3. Inserts the order record (letting database trigger generate the order_id)
4. Fetches SKU data for referenced SKUs
5. Creates order items linking orders and SKUs
6. Generates jobs for each order item (quantity Ã— items)
7. Creates initial job history entries
8. Revalidates relevant paths

**Supabase Interactions**:

## Integration Points

### Cross-File Dependencies

- **order-actions.ts** depends on job-related constants from `constants/job-workflow.ts`
- **job-actions.ts** depends on order status mapping from `constants/job-workflow.ts`
- **image-actions.ts** depends on storage utilities from `lib/supabase-storage.ts`
- **sku-sequence-actions.ts** depends on storage utilities for batch image handling

### Shared Patterns

1. **Performance Monitoring**: All actions use performance.now() to track execution time
2. **Comprehensive Logging**: Consistent logging pattern with info, debug, and error levels
3. **Mock Mode Support**: Order and job actions check for mock mode to support development
4. **Path Revalidation**: All actions that modify data revalidate relevant Next.js paths
5. **Error Handling**: Consistent try/catch patterns with detailed error logging
6. **Service Client Usage**: All actions use the service role client for elevated permissions

## Security Considerations

1. All actions are marked with 'use server' to ensure they only execute on the server
2. Service role client is used for elevated database access
3. No sensitive information is returned to the client
4. Input validation is performed before database operations
5. Error messages are sanitized before returning to the client

## Performance Optimizations

1. Batch operations are used where possible (createSkuBatch)
2. Parallel processing for image uploads in batch operations
3. Efficient queries with count:exact, head:true for counting operations
4. Selective column fetching to minimize data transfer
5. Path revalidation is targeted to specific routes
