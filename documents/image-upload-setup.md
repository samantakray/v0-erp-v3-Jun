# Image Upload Feature Setup Documentation

This document outlines the implementation steps for integrating image upload and management features into the Jewellery ERP system, covering Phase 1 Step 1 through Phase 3 Step 2.

---

## Phase 1: Initial Setup

### Step 1: Supabase Storage Setup

**Objective**: To establish the foundational storage infrastructure within Supabase for handling product images securely and efficiently.

**Reasoning**:
- **Centralized Storage**: Provides a dedicated, scalable cloud storage solution for all product images.
- **Security**: Leverages Supabase's Row Level Security (RLS) to control access to image files, ensuring only authorized users or processes can upload, view, or manage them.
- **Performance**: Optimizes image delivery by utilizing Supabase's integrated CDN capabilities.

**Files Added/Updated**:
- **Supabase Dashboard Configuration**:
    - Created a new storage bucket (e.g., `product-images`).
    - Configured RLS policies for the `product-images` bucket to allow authenticated users to upload and read, and potentially service roles to delete/update.
- `database/rls-policies.sql` (Conceptual update, as RLS is typically configured via Supabase UI or migration scripts)

### Step 2: Supabase Client Integration

**Objective**: To set up the necessary Supabase client instances for interacting with the storage service from both server-side (Server Actions) and client-side components.

**Reasoning**:
- **Secure Server-Side Operations**: Using a service role key on the server ensures elevated permissions for critical operations like deleting images or updating database records without exposing sensitive keys to the client.
- **Client-Side Interaction**: An anonymous key on the client allows for direct image uploads from the browser while still respecting RLS policies.
- **Reusability**: Centralizing client creation prevents redundant code and ensures consistent configuration.

**Files Added/Updated**:
- `lib/supabaseClient.ts`:
    - Created `supabase` (client-side) and `createServiceClient` (server-side) functions.
    - Configured Supabase client instances with appropriate API keys and URLs.

### Step 3: Basic Image Upload Server Action

**Objective**: To create a server action that handles the actual file upload process to Supabase Storage, including basic validation.

**Reasoning**:
- **Server-Side Logic**: Encapsulates the file upload logic on the server, preventing direct client-to-storage interaction for security and control.
- **Validation**: Ensures uploaded files meet predefined criteria (e.g., type, size, dimensions) before storage.
- **Error Handling**: Provides a robust mechanism to catch and report upload failures.

**Files Added/Updated**:
- `lib/supabase-storage.ts`:
    - Added `validateImageFile` for client-side and server-side file validation.
    - Added `uploadImageToSupabase` for handling the upload to the specified bucket and path.
    - Added `deleteImageFromSupabase` for removing images from storage.
    - Added `generateSkuImagePath` for creating unique and structured paths for SKU images.
- `app/actions/image-actions.ts`:
    - Created `uploadSkuImage` server action to orchestrate the image upload process, linking it to a specific SKU.

---

## Phase 2: Backend Integration

### Step 1: Update Server Actions for SKU Creation

**Objective**: To modify the existing SKU creation server actions to incorporate image upload functionality, ensuring images are linked to newly created SKUs.

**Reasoning**:
- **Atomic Operations**: Ensures that an image is uploaded and its URL is recorded in the database as part of a single, cohesive SKU creation process.
- **Data Consistency**: Prevents orphaned images in storage if the database insertion fails, and vice-versa.
- **Pre-generated IDs**: Allows for images to be uploaded to a permanent path even before the SKU is fully committed to the database, by using a pre-generated SKU ID.

**Files Added/Updated**:
- `app/actions/sku-actions.ts`:
    - Modified `createSku` to accept an optional `imageFile` parameter.
    - Integrated `uploadImageToSupabase` within `createSku` to handle image uploads.
    - Ensured `image_url` is saved to the `skus` table.
    - Added cleanup logic to delete uploaded images if the database transaction fails.
    - Modified `createSkuBatch` to handle image files for each SKU in the batch, including individual uploads and collective cleanup on failure.

### Step 2: Add Image Management Actions

**Objective**: To provide server-side actions for updating and deleting existing SKU images, allowing for post-creation image management.

**Reasoning**:
- **Flexibility**: Enables users to replace outdated or incorrect images without having to delete and recreate the entire SKU.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures that when an image is updated or deleted, the corresponding database record is also updated, and old images are properly removed from storage.
- **Auditability**: Centralizes image management logic for easier tracking and debugging.

**Files Added/Updated**:
- `app/actions/image-actions.ts`:
    - Added `updateSkuImage`: Fetches the current image URL, uploads the new image, updates the SKU record, and then deletes the old image from storage.
    - Added `deleteSkuImage`: Fetches the current image URL, deletes it from storage, and updates the SKU record to a placeholder image URL.
    - Implemented `revalidatePath` calls to ensure UI reflects changes immediately.

## Phase 3: Frontend Integration

### Step 1: Update New SKU Sheet (`components/new-sku-sheet.tsx`)

**Objective**: To integrate the new `ImageUpload` component into the `NewSKUSheet` and handle image upload states and errors for single and batch SKU creation.

**Reasoning**:
- **Unified UI**: Provides a consistent and user-friendly interface for image uploads across different SKU creation flows.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Displays upload progress and errors directly within the form, improving user experience.
- **Validation Integration**: Prevents form submission if there are pending image upload errors.

**Files Added/Updated**:
- `components/new-sku-sheet.tsx`:
    - Replaced manual file input with the `ImageUpload` component.
    - Managed `imageUrl` state for each SKU variant.
    - Implemented `uploadErrors` state to track and display image-specific errors.
    - Updated `handleImageChange` and `handleImageError` to interact with the `ImageUpload` component's callbacks.
    - Modified `handleCreateSkusBatch` to check for `uploadErrors` before submission.
    - Passed `skuId` (or a temporary ID) to `ImageUpload` for correct path generation.

### Step 2: Update Full Page Form (`app/skus/new/page.tsx`)

**Objective**: To connect the full-page SKU creation form to the backend server actions and integrate the `ImageUpload` component for single SKU creation.

**Reasoning**:
- **Backend Connectivity**: Ensures the form properly sends data, including image files, to the server for processing.
- **Robust Submission**: Handles loading states, success messages, and error notifications for a smooth user experience.
- **Consistency**: Aligns the full-page form's image handling with the sheet component, using the same `ImageUpload` component and backend logic.

**Files Added/Updated**:
- `app/skus/new/page.tsx`:
    - Integrated the `ImageUpload` component for single SKU creation.
    - Updated `handleSubmit` to call the `createSku` server action, passing the image file.
    - Implemented `isSubmitting` state for loading indicators.
    - Used `useToast` for user feedback on success and error.
    - Added navigation to `/skus` after successful creation.
    - Ensured validation for `uploadErrors` before allowing form submission.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the image upload feature implementation, detailing the objectives, reasoning, and specific file changes for each phase and step.


# User Experience (UX)

The user journey is designed to be straightforward and intuitive:

1. The user sees a clear "Click or drag to upload" area for each SKU they are defining.
2. During the upload, visual cues like a spinning icon and a progress bar keep the user informed.
3. If an error occurs (e.g., wrong file type), the form displays a specific error message and a "Retry" button, guiding the user to a solution.
4. A successful upload replaces the upload area with a thumbnail of the image, along with "Preview" and "Delete" buttons, giving the user immediate confirmation and control.
5. The main "Create" button is disabled if any uploads are in progress or have failed, preventing the user from creating SKUs with incomplete or broken image links.

## Concerns & Recommendations

The feature is well-implemented for its purpose, but based on the documentation and code, here are several areas for improvement, categorized by priority.

### High Priority (Immediate Business Value & Core Functionality)

1. **Concern: Lack of Post-Creation Management**
   - The current workflow only handles image uploads for new SKUs. There is no way for a user to replace or delete an image for an existing SKU.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement the "Replace/Delete Existing Images" feature outlined in the documentation. This is a critical feature for managing a product catalog over time.

2. **Concern: Performance and Cost**
   - The system uploads the original, full-size image file directly. This can lead to slow upload times for users, increased storage costs, and slower page loads where images are displayed.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement client-side image compression before upload. This would significantly reduce file sizes, improving UX and lowering storage costs, without a noticeable loss in quality for web display.

3. **Concern: Limited Detail in Previews**
   - For a jewelry business, minute details are critical. The current preview is a simple modal.
   - **Recommendation**: As suggested in the docs, enhance the Image Preview with Zoom functionality. This would allow users to inspect the quality and details of an image before associating it with a SKU, reducing errors.

### Medium Priority (Operational Efficiency & UX Enhancements)

1. **Concern: Potential for Orphaned Files**
   - If a user uploads an image but then closes the sheet without creating the SKU, the image file may remain in the storage bucket, becoming an "orphaned" file that consumes storage space and incurs cost.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement the Automatic Cleanup of Unused Images script mentioned in the documentation. This should be run periodically to find and delete images in storage that are not referenced by any SKU in the database.

2. **Concern: Inefficient Multi-Image Workflow**
   - Jewelry products often require multiple images (e.g., different angles, on a model). The current UI only supports one image per SKU.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement Multiple File Selection and a dedicated UI to manage several images for a single SKU. This would be a major efficiency improvement.

### Low Priority (Advanced Optimizations)

1. **Concern: One-Size-Fits-All Image Serving**
   - The full-resolution image is used everywhere (thumbnails, previews, etc.), which is inefficient for page loading.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement a system to Generate Multiple Image Sizes (thumbnail, medium, full) on the backend after an upload. The application can then serve the most appropriate size for the context, dramatically improving performance.

2. **Concern: Lack of Modern Format Support**
   - The system uses standard image formats like JPEG and PNG.
