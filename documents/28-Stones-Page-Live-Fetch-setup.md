Updated Plan: Implement Live Data Fetching for the Stone Lots Page
This revised plan incorporates insights from the codebase to ensure a safe and consistent implementation.

Step 1: Define a Comprehensive 
StoneLot
 Type
Objective: Create a new, more detailed TypeScript interface named 
StoneLot
 in 
types/index.ts
. This type will accurately represent the full structure of the stone_lots table from Supabase, including all fields you want to display (lot_number, stone_type, shape, quality, etc.).
Files to Change:
types/index.ts
Risk Level: Very Low
Validation: The existing 
StoneLotData
 is confirmed to be too simplistic for our needs. Creating a new type is additive and won't break anything.


Step 2: Create a Dedicated Data Fetching Function
Objective: In 
lib/api-service.ts
, create a new function called fetchAllStoneLots. This function will query the stone_lots table and return all relevant columns without adding the "None" option. This keeps the original 
fetchStoneLots
 intact for its intended use in dropdowns.
Files to Change:
lib/api-service.ts
Risk Level: Low
Validation: The documentation and function implementation confirm 
fetchStoneLots
 is not suitable for this page. Creating a new function is the standard practice in this codebase for fetching a list of all items for a table view (e.g., 
fetchAllJobs
).



Step 3: Implement Client-Side Data Fetching in the Page
Objective: Convert 
app/stones/page.tsx
 to a client component by adding "use client". Then, use useState and useEffect hooks to call our new fetchAllStoneLots function, managing the loading, data, and error states, just like the 
app/orders/page.tsx
 does.
Files to Change:
app/stones/page.tsx
Risk Level: Low
Validation: This now perfectly mirrors the established and working pattern from the Orders page, ensuring consistency.


Step 4: Update the UI to Display Live Data
Objective: Modify the JSX in 
app/stones/page.tsx
 to render the data from the component's state. The table columns will be updated to match the fields in our new 
StoneLot
 type. We will also add conditional rendering to show a loading spinner while fetching and an error message if the request fails.
Files to Change:
app/stones/page.tsx
Risk Level: Very Low
Validation: This is a standard UI update with minimal risk. The data structure will be well-defined by our new 
StoneLot
 type, preventing runtime errors.
