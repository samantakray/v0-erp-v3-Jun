### Diamond Usage Details ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
- **Diamond Lot** (dropdown from database `diamond_lots` table) - *Updated from "Diamond Type"*
- Diamond Return Quantity (Pcs)
- Diamond Return Weight (Cts)
- Diamond Loss Quantity (Pcs)
- Diamond Loss Weight (Cts)
- Diamond Break Quantity (Pcs)
- Diamond Break Weight (Cts)

### Colored Stone Usage Details ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Stone Lot** (dropdown from database `stone_lots` table) - *Updated from "Colored Stone Type"*
- Colored Stones Return Quantity (Pcs)
- Colored Stones Return Weight (Cts)
- Colored Stones Loss Quantity (Pcs)
- Colored Stones Loss Weight (Cts)
- Colored Stones Break Quantity (Pcs)
- Colored Stones Break Weight (Cts)

## **Summary**
Part 1 (Frontend Implementation) is **100% COMPLETE** and fully functional with database-driven dropdowns, real-time calculations, and consistent UI patterns. The QC tab now provides comprehensive material tracking capabilities matching the existing Stone and Diamond tabs.

**Next Phase**: Part 2 (Backend Integration) to persist the usage details data to the database and enable full end-to-end functionality. 

## PHASE 2 IMPLEMENTED 

Objective


  The primary objective was to perform a full end-to-end integration of
  the extended Quality Control (QC) feature. This involved confirming
  the existing backend setup, implementing server-side validation,
  aligning frontend data structures with backend expectations,
  standardizing logging, and updating all relevant documentation to
  reflect the final, completed state of the feature.

  Execution Summary


   * Step 1: Use Type Definitions (Confirmed)
       * Result: Confirmed that types/index.ts provides a correct and
         authoritative definition for all QCData structures. This served
         as the foundational contract for all subsequent frontend and
         backend work.
       * Files Reviewed: types/index.ts


   * Step 2: Update `updateJobPhase` Action (Confirmed)
       * Result: Confirmed that the updateJobPhase server action was
         already correctly configured to accept the extended QCData
         payload, validating the backend's readiness for the new data
         shape.
       * Files Reviewed: app/actions/job-actions.ts


   * Step 3: Add Server-Side Validation (Completed)
       * Result: Successfully added robust, schema-based validation for
         all incoming QC data. The lib/validation.ts file was updated with
          Zod schemas, and the updateJobPhase action now uses this to
         reject invalid data, significantly improving data integrity.
       * Files Changed: lib/validation.ts, app/actions/job-actions.ts


   * Step 4: Ensure Job History Capture (Confirmed)
       * Result: Confirmed that the existing logic correctly captures the
         full, extended QCData payload in the job_history table, ensuring
         a complete audit trail without needing changes.
       * Files Reviewed: app/actions/job-actions.ts


   * Step 5: Update API Service Functions (Confirmed)
       * Result: Confirmed that the API service functions in
         lib/api-service.ts already returned the qcData field, making the
         extended data available to the frontend without modification.
       * Files Reviewed: lib/api-service.ts


   * Step 6: Enhance Error Handling & Logging (Completed)
       * Result: All logger calls within the app/actions/job-actions.ts
         file were reviewed and refactored. They now conform to the
         strict, structured format required by the project's logging
         utility, leading to more consistent and useful application logs.
       * Files Reviewed: lib/logger.ts
       * Files Changed: app/actions/job-actions.ts


   * Step 7: Confirm DB Schema Support (Confirmed)
       * Result: Confirmed that the jobs.qc_data column's JSONB type in
         the database schema is flexible enough to store the new data
         structure without requiring any migrations.
       * Files Reviewed: (Implicitly confirmed via review of
         database/schema.sql in previous context).


   * Step 8: Fix Frontend/Backend Data Mismatch (Completed)
       * Result: This critical step was fully implemented. The
         quality-check/page.tsx component was re-architected to integrate
         the existing GoldUsageRow, DiamondUsageRow, and
         ColoredStoneUsageRow components. The page now correctly fetches
         necessary lot data, manages state for the detailed material usage
          arrays, and sends the complete, accurate QCData object to the
         backend.
       * Files Reviewed: components/gold-usage-row.tsx,
         components/diamond-usage-row.tsx,
         components/colored-stone-usage-row.tsx, lib/api-service.ts
       * Files Changed:
         app/orders/[orderId]/jobs/[jobId]/quality-check/page.tsx


   * Step 9: Update Documentation (Completed)
       * Result: All relevant documentation was updated. The API
         reference, server action details, and workflow descriptions now
         accurately document the new complex QCData structure and the
         server-side validation process. The original planning document
         was also updated to mark all backend integration tasks as
         complete.
       * Files Changed: documents/25-qc-received-tab-setup.md,
         documents/06-api-reference.md, documents/16-actions.md,
         documents/19-order-page-functionality.md
